Notepad++ : Log Syntax highlight for dark mode
##Notepad++_VisualStudio_DarkMode_Style.xml :
    Dark mode style for Notepa++ forked from https://github.com/SeanCline/Npp-VS2012-Dark with little changes to mimic Visual Studio
    
##Notepad++_Log_Highlight_Dark_Mode.UDL.xml
  Log syntax highlight with dark mode. I tried various different option shared by other users but somewhere it was braking syntax highlighting. I crated it for my own purpuse to hight some custom words. 
  If this is breaking in your hightliging got to Language -> Define your language -> Operators & Delimiters 
  Play around Delimiter 1 styler. Check uncheck nesting.
